Upon looking at the prompt, I think I need a frontend (which I'll use react for), a backend API, and a database
I'm not sure what type of database I'll be using, but I'm planning on using an ORM to make my project agnostic to that choice for the most part
While looking for Node ORMs I found LoopBack which seems to provide some convenient functions for generating APIs
Looking further into Loopback, it's owned by IBM so I'm going to give it a shot and wireframe out an API
Originally I planned on making an Express API with the Express CLI, but LB provides its own CLI which should hopefully make things easier to integrate
One thing I've realized is now that this LoopBack API is up and running, there are a lot of extra endpoints that I don't necessarily want exposed to the users
After implementing the employee cost function, I'm feeling much more confident about this framework especially looking at the documentation on loopback.io
My major concern is integrating this with a frontend; I'm not sure if I want to store the built client files in the client directory or stand the applications up separately

As far as I can tell, this outline for the API is pretty close to what I expect the final version of this to look like
From here I think I just want to make some automated tests

As I've started making the frontend, I realize I should ask some specifics about the requirements
- Should the company cost display be a list of companies and their associated costs or a dropdown that allows you to look at one company at a time?
- The requirements call for one table/collection to store the data in the five fields; does that mean there shouldn't be a second table for the company information?
- The requirements call for a separate form for the company cost calculation; should this be on a separate page?
