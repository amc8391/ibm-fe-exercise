Upon looking at the prompt, I think I need a frontend (which I'll use react for), a backend API, and a database
I'm not sure what type of database I'll be using, but I'm planning on using an ORM to make my project agnostic to that choice for the most part
While looking for Node ORMs I found LoopBack which seems to provide some convenient functions for generating APIs
Looking further into Loopback, it's owned by IBM so I'm going to give it a shot and wireframe out an API
Originally I planned on making an Express API with the Express CLI, but LB provides its own CLI which should hopefully make things easier to integrate
One thing I've realized is now that this LoopBack API is up and running, there are a lot of extra endpoints that I don't necessarily want exposed to the users
After implementing the employee cost function, I'm feeling much more confident about this framework especially looking at the documentation on loopback.io
My major concern is integrating this with a frontend; I'm not sure if I want to store the built client files in the client directory or stand the applications up separately
